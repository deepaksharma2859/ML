What is Machine Learning

Field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly
programmed.


Why Machine Learning

Many programs can’t be hardcoded.For example Autonomous helicopter,handwriting
recognition, most of Natural Language Processing
(NLP), Computer Vision etc.
User based recommendations can’t be done without machine learning.As
each user requires a different program,it is not quite possible
to write so many programs for so many people.Ex Amazon,Netflix etc

In machine learning we have mainly two types of learnings:-

Supervised Learning: is like learning with a teacher training dataset is like a teacher the training dataset is used to train the machine

Example:
Classification: Machine is trained to classify something into some class.
classifying whether a patient has disease or not
classifying whether an email is spam or not
Regression: Machine is trained to predict some value like price, weight or height.
predicting house/property price
predicting stock market price

Unsupervised Learning: is like learning without a teacher the machine learns through observation & find structures in data
Example:
Clustering: A clustering problem is where you want to discover the inherent groupings in the data such as grouping customers by purchasing behavior
Association: An association rule learning problem is where you want to discover rules that describe large portions of your data such as people that buy X also tend to buy Y
